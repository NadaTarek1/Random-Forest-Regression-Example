## Repository description

This repository contains an example of using SKLearn library in python to build and save a regression model using Random Forest Regression. this models predicts the quality of wine based on a number of other features.

The code is very simple and the steps of implementation are documented by us in the code for better clarity.

You can download and run "main.py" file using python.

## Prerequisites:
- Python 2.7+ or Python 3
- NumPy library
- Pandas library
- Scikit-Learn (a.k.a. sklearn)
